# Analysing 18S data from Pearl Harbour 

First look at sequence data arriving 11.01.2018. Needed to see if approach is successful.
If so, 18S data can be generated on large scale. This data also needs to be combined
with the old sequence data. This folder was created 11.01.2018 and last updated
11.01.2018. The GitHub folder is version tracked.
